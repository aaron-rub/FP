title: My quiz plan</p>

<h1 id="my-quiz-plan">My quiz plan:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Create a quiz similar to Jeopardy 
(Just to get a feel for the program)</li>
  <li>Think
(How to make my website/ function stand out)</li>
  <li>Take action
(Use what I know from building the original quiz and the brainstorm plan to create what website I had in mind)</li>
  <li>Check with teacher and classmates
(Ask teacher and classmates if anything needs to be added or changed)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="drafting">Drafting:</h1>

<p>For my code I used a simple repeating command “on event (“Button name”,”click”, function(){“
    (what this did was set the command for a button to take you to a separate page)</p>

<h1 id="data-abstraction">Data Abstraction</h1>

<p>An example of Data Abstraction in this program is the “font size” chart. It holds multiple selections that represent different sizes. A random number function takes a random size selection from the list and sets the default font size to that selection.</p>

<h1 id="the-point">The point</h1>

<p>The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but specifically java script.</p>

<p># Managing Complexity</p>

<p>An example of complexity management in this quiz is the layout. The quiz is divided into two parts: pasword and exploration in the program. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, each command has its own defined function.</p>
