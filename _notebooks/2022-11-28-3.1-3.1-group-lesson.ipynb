    "    1. What exactly IS a variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "        A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time\n",

    "\n",
    "        String\n",

    "    3. Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "        So you don't get them mixed up\n",

    "    Strings is a series of characters (numbers, letters, etc), one example of a string is your name or your id because strings can contain both numbers and letters.\n",
