    "\n",
    "Imagine a virtual world that resembles a city, with buildings, streets, and vehicles. The city is populated by virtual people, each with their own characteristics, behaviors, and goals. These virtual people, or \"agents,\" can interact with each other and the environment in realistic ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible goals for the agents could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Going to work or school\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running errands (e.g. grocery shopping, visiting the bank)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Socializing with other agents\n",
    "\n",
    "- Participating in leisure activities (e.g. going to the park, attending a concert)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve their goals, the agents would need to navigate the city, make decisions, and interact with  other agents and the environment. For example, an agent might decide to take the bus to work in the morning, but if they are running late they might choose to hail a taxi instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation would include realistic physics and traffic rules, so that agents and vehicles move and behave in a believable way. The city would also include different types of buildings and landmarks, such as offices, shops, and parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the simulation runs, the agents would go about their daily routines and interact with each other in various ways. The simulation could also include random events, such as traffic accidents or weather changes, to add an element of unpredictability and realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the simulation would provide a rich and realistic virtual world for the agents to inhabit and explore, and could be used to study and analyze the behavior of large groups of agents in a city-like environment."

    "#### HACK 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The rolling dice simulation in Python is a program that generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the outcome of rolling a single six-sided die. The program may be used to simulate multiple rolls of the die and track the results, allowing the user to study the distribution of the outcomes and the probability of certain numbers being rolled. The program can be implemented using the built-in random module in Python, which provides a function for generating random numbers. To simulate rolling a die, the program would first import the random module, then use the random.randint() function to generate a random integer between 1 and 6, which would represent the outcome of the roll. The program could then output the result of the roll and continue to simulate additional rolls as desired."

For example, increasing the bounciness will cause the ball to bounce higher, and increasing the number of bounces will cause the ball to bounce more times before coming to a stop."
