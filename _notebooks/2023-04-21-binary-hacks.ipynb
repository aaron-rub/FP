    "First I created the decimal calculator below because I was confused on what the hacks were, but the Binary calculator that I added does basic mathmatical operations as well as conducting the mathmatical operations with varying bits  as shown below. The decimal calcutlator is also quite simple, it has a base of 2n and prompts the user to input the exponent. This is because to find any decimals its always a base of 2 to the power of the number of bit you want. For example if you want to know what the value for the 6th bit IF it is activated, for example \"1000000\" The value would be 2^6. It then prompts the user for ANOTHER exponent so it can conduct basic mathmatical operations. For example \"2^6 + 2^3\" OR \"1000000 + 1000\""
