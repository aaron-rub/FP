# Errors and how to correct errors 
How to make corrections to your code
- There are many different types of errors
- There is no such thing as writing a program without having errors
- There are four different types of errors:
- - Logic Errors
- - Syntax Errors
- - Runtime Errors
- - Overflow Errors
- Logic Errors is a problem caused by the programmer, it has nothing due to the machine.
- Syntax Errors happen when the programmer does something that doesnt line up with the rules of the language that they are using
- Runtime Errors happens when in the middle of the program the program fails, it usually occurs because of a certain input.
- Overflow Errors is when the program maxes out the amount of memory allocation to a certain variable

## What I can incorperate into my daily schedule
- When I encounter an error, before doing anything else I should find the error and determine what type is it
