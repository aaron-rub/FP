title: My quiz plan

# My porgect plan:
 
-  Create a quiz similar to Jeopardy 
(Just to get a feel for the program)
-  Think
(How to make my quiz unique)
-  Take action
(Use what I know from building the original quiz and the brainstorm plan to create the quiz on my code.org)
-  Check with teacher and classmates
(Ask teacher and classmates if anything needs to be added or changed)
 
# Drafting:
 
For my code I used a simple repeating command "on event ("Button name","click", function(){"
I had it so that on the event of the button that I had set as the correct answer was clicked it would change the users screen to a green check mark. If they were to click on a different button that I had identified as a incorrect it would display a red X mark.

 
# Data Abstraction
 
An example of Data Abstraction in this program is the "font size" chart. It holds multiple selections that represent different sizes. A random number function takes a random size selection from the list and sets the default font size to that selection.
 
# The point
 
 The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but specifically java script.
 
 # Managing Complexity
 
 An example of complexity management in this quiz is the layout. The quiz is divided into two parts: pasword and exploration in the program. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, each command has its own defined function.
